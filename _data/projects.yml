  description: "sleuth is a transcript level differential expression analysis tool for RNA-Seq. It is different from most tools in that it incorporates the inferential variability from transcript abundance estimation.<br><br>sleuth also allow scientists to interactively explore their data using a R Shiny application which can be easily shared to encourage reproducibility and scientific sharing. A demo of this app can be found at <a href='http://lair.berkeley.edu' target='_blank'><strong>the bear's lair</strong></a>."

  description: "kallisto is an incredibly fast and accurate transcript abundance estimation tool for RNA-Seq. It forgoes the costly step of alignment by implementing a novel idea which we call a pseudoalignment. Pseudoalignment along with a re-parameterization of the likelihood allows for extremely fast inference of transcript abundance estimation which is now possible on the laptop in about 5 minutes."
