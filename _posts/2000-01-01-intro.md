  I am currently a PhD candidate in Berkeley EECS studying computational genomics in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/" target="_blank">Lior Pachterâ€™s</a> group.
  I primarily work on developing RNA-Seq analysis methods.

  Beyond academics I enjoy road and mountain cycling, hiking, finding new places to eat, and interesting television shows (my guilty pleasure).
  Recently, I've become very interested in voice recognition and use <a href="http://voicecode.io/" target="_blank">VoiceCode.io</a> to perform most of my work.
