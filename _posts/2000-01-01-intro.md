  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Jonathan Pritchard's group at Stanford.
  Broadly, I am interested in how human genetic variation affects molecular phenotypes.
  The majority of my work is in developing computational and statistical methods for understanding modern genomic data.
  Most of my previous work has been in developing methods for understanding RNA-Seq data.

  Previously, I received my PhD from Berkeley EECS studying computational genomics in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/" target="_blank">Lior Pachterâ€™s</a> group.

  Beyond academics I enjoy road and mountain cycling, running, and finding new places to eat.
  I am a large proponent of alternative input devices, particularly voice recognition.
  In fact, I use <a href="http://voicecode.io/" target="_blank">VoiceCode.io</a> to perform most of my work.
