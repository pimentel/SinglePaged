  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Jonathan Pritchard's</a> group at Stanford and am generously supported by the <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/programs/hanna-h-gray-fellows-program#Fellows" target="_blank">HHMI Hanna H. Gray fellows program</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Broadly, I am interested in how human genetic variation affects molecular phenotypes with the goal of understanding how genes regulate each other.
  The majority of my work is in developing computational and statistical methods for understanding modern genomic data, primarily RNA-seq.

  <p>
  Previously, I received my PhD from Berkeley EECS studying computational genomics in <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Lior Pachterâ€™s</a> group.

  Beyond academics I enjoy cycling, running, and food.
  I am a large proponent of alternative input devices, particularly voice recognition (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05588-x" target="_blank">read more here</a>).
  In fact, I use <a href="https://talonvoice.com" target="_blank">Talon</a> to perform most of my work.
